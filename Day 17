Step 1: Navigate to Azure SQL in the Azure portal and click "Create."
Step 2: Fill in details like Resource Group, Admin Login, Password, Database Name, and Region. Create a server if needed.
Step 3: Choose Public or Private Endpoints and configure networking settings as required.
Step 4: Set additional options like Data Source DB, Collation, and Timezone.
Step 5: Click "Review + Create" and then "Create." Once deployed, go to the resource to view the database.

2. Verify Azure SQL in SSMS:

Step 1: Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Step 2: Connect to the database using the Server Name, SQL Server Authentication, Admin Login, and Password.
Step 3: Run queries like SELECT @@VERSION; and SELECT * FROM sys.databases; to verify the database.
Optional: Create a test table to validate functionality: insert data and query it to confirm.
