1. Create a Virtual Machine and Virtual Network (VNet):

Search for "Virtual Machines" and click "Create."
Enter details like resource group, VM name (e.g., Task21VM), region, image, size, and admin credentials.
In the Networking tab, create a new VNet (e.g., Task21Vnet) with IP range 10.0.0.0/16 and subnet 10.0.0.0/24.
Disable Boot Diagnostics under Monitoring, review, and click "Create."

2. Create a VM in a Different VNet:

Follow the same steps as above, but name the VM "MVM" and create a new VNet (e.g., MVnet) with IP range 172.16.0.0/16 and subnet 172.16.0.0/24.

3. Test Connection with Network Watcher:

Search for "Network Watcher" and select "Connection Troubleshoot."
Enter source VM, destination type, protocol, and ports.
Run diagnostics to test connectivity.

4. Configure VNet Peering:

In Task21Vnet, go to Peerings, and add a new peering with MVnet.
Enable access and traffic forwarding between VNets.
Repeat in MVnet to verify the peering setup.

5. Create a Custom Route:

Navigate to "Route Tables" and create a new route table.
Add routes with details like route name, destination type, hop type, and address.
Associate the route table with a subnet in the VNet.
