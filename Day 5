Creating and Configuring Azure Resources

1. Create a Virtual Network:

-Navigate to "Virtual Network" from the Azure menu or search bar.
-Select "Create" and provide details like Resource Group, VNet name, and Region.
-Configure IP addresses, add a subnet named myBackendSubnet with an IP range, and enable "Azure Bastion Host."
-Proceed to "Review + Create," then deploy the VNet.

2. Create a NAT Gateway:

-Search for "NAT Gateway" in Azure.
-Provide details such as Resource Group, name, Region, and Public IP address.
-Link it to the VNet's backend subnet created earlier, then complete the deployment.

3. Create an External Load Balancer:

-Search for "Load Balancer" and choose "Public" as the type.
-Add a Frontend IP configuration with a public IP, linked to the VNet and subnet.
-Configure Backend Pools by linking IP addresses and VNets.
-Add Inbound Load Balancing rules with health probes and session persistence. Deploy the load balancer.

4. Create an Internal Load Balancer:

-Similar to the external load balancer, but choose "Internal" as the type.
-Use private IP addresses for Frontend configurations and Backend Pools.
-Add rules and health probes to manage traffic internally. Deploy the load balancer.
-This setup ensures seamless networking across VNets and resources in Azure.
