Step 4: Select the Scope (e.g., Free Trial), then click Review + Create.
Step 5: Click CREATE, and after deployment, go to the resource to view the Network Manager.

Create Virtual Networks

Step 6: Create Virtual Networks based on your requirements, ensuring they are in the same Resource Group as the Network Manager.
Step 7: Assign unique IP address ranges to avoid overlaps and add tags if needed.

Create a Virtual Network Gateway

Step 8: Search for Virtual Network Gateway in the Azure portal search bar.
Step 9: Click CREATE to start the gateway setup.
Step 10: Provide the required details:
  Use the same Resource Group as before.
  Enter a Gateway Name.

  Configure a Public IP Address Name.
Step 11: Click Review + Create and then CREATE.
Step 12: After deployment, open the resource to view the Virtual Network Gateway.

Create Network Groups in Network Manager

Step 13: Open the Network Manager resource and go to Network Groups.
Step 14: Enter a name for the group and select Virtual Network as the member type. Click Create.
Step 15: Open the created Network Group and manually add VNets as members.

Create Configurations in Network Manager

Step 16: In the Network Manager, go to Configurations and create a Connectivity Configuration.
Step 17: Provide a name and select the Hub and Spoke topology.
Step 18: Choose the VNet to be used as the Hub.
Step 19: Add the Network Groups and enable connectivity within them.
Step 20: Click Review + Create and then CREATE.

Deploy the Configurations

Step 21: Select the Connectivity Configuration you created.
Step 22: Specify the Region.
Step 23: Click Review + Deploy and then DEPLOY.

3.Testing Connectivity

Create a Windows Virtual Machine
Step 1: Search for Virtual Machine in the Azure portal.
Step 2: Select Windows to create a Windows-based Virtual Machine.
Step 3: Fill in the necessary details:
  Use the same Resource Group as before.
  Provide a VM Name.
  Select a Region, Image, and Size.
  Configure the admin account with a Username and Password.
  Disable public inbound ports.
Step 4: In the Networking section, select the desired VNet. An IP address will be created automatically.
Step 5: Click Review + Create, and after reviewing, click CREATE.
Step 6: Once the deployment is complete, open the resource to view the VM.

Verify Connectivity

Step 7: Go to the Networking section of the VM and open the Network Interface Card (NIC).
Step 8: Navigate to Effective Routes in the Help section to check the routes.
Step 9: Open the Hub VNet and go to Peerings to confirm that the VNets are successfully connected.
